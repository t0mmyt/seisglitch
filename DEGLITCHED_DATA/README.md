# Deglitched (corrected) Data


As outlined in the paper, four groups within the InSight project have developed code for the glitch and spike removal (=deglitching).
Here, we provide a selection of deglitched seismic events from Mars that the interested user may use or compare to her/his corrections.
Future updates of these files will have no official announcements, however, the code versions used for the deglitching are 
indicated in the file names of the deglitched data. Version numbers differ across the four groups and have no temperoal
implication, meaning version 4 of one group compared to version 1 of another group is not necessarily indicating more recent updates.
On the other hand, version numbers within a group allow you to conclude temporality, i.e., higher version numbers are more recent.


The four groups and their lead analysts are:
- MPS (John-Robert Scholz & Rudolf Widmer-Schnidrig, SEISglitch toolbox)
- ISAE (Baptiste Pinot & Raphaël Garcia, MATLAB)
- UCLA (Paul Davis, MATLAB)
- IPGP (Philippe Lognonné, MATLAB)


Note further that the provided files may show differences for some seismic events across the different groups.
This is because some groups may have merged overlaps in the input files prior to processing whilst others did not. 
These differences are typically not signficant, especially for total data lengths of less than 1 day.
