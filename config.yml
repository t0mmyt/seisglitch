### State here waveform files and inventory file to work with that will be used by the different functions. 
# Inventory file: path to file or data service: either 'IPGP' or 'IRIS'. If left empty, default is 'IPGP'.
# Waveform files: must contain 3 seismic traces (components U, V, W) of either VBB or SP.
# Waveform formats understood: https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.write.html#supported-format
# Use 'download' module of this toolbox to retrieve data / inventory if desired.

waveform_files:
  # should be files containing 3 seismic components (UVW). Gaps and overlaps are handeled.

### DETECT GLITCH FUNCTION
detect:

  detector:
    taper_length_per_side: 0.0         # in %, in tapered parts no glitch detection is done
    pre_filt: False                    # see: https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.remove_response.html
    water_level: 60                    # if both options given 'pre_filt' and 'water_level', both are applied. Usually, you only want to use one option.
    ACCfilter:                         # this filter is applied to the accleration data. See ObsPy filters: https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.filter.html
      type : 'bandpass'
      options: {'freqmin':0.001, 'freqmax':0.1, 'corners':3, 'zerophase':True}
      string: '0.001 < f < 0.1'        # name your filter as you like. This will be used for output information only.
    threshold: 0.5e-9                  # triggering threshold of derivative of filtered acceleration data. Unit therefore is m/s**3. More senstitiv setting would be: 0.2
    plot_triggering: False             # if True, trigger plot is shown (one for each component. These glitch candidates are not yet time unified and checked against polarization)
    glitch_min_length: 5               # In seconds. minimum distance in seconds between 2 glitches. Before that, no new glitch can be declared
    glitch_length: 25                  # In seconds. Only used to declare glitch end time. Choose < 100 s. For VBB 25s is fine, for SP 50 s is fine.
    glitch_min_polarization: 0.91      # applied to calculated polarization of both gain corrected (set:0 if not wished). Less senstitiv setting would be e.g.: 0.95



### REMOVE GLITCH FUNCTION
remove:

  glitch_detector_files:               # each detected glitch, no matter on which component detected, will attempted to be removed on each component!
    # list here the files given by the detector module. These detected glitches will attempted to be removed, depending on the waveform data found to it.
    - Example/glitches_XB.ELYSE.03.BH?_2019-05-22T23:18:50.649000Z-2019-05-23T23:59:36.249000Z_raw.txt

  remover:                                # 'inventory_file' is taken from the detect module. From it the instrument response is extracted. ATTENTION: InSight meta-data use many epochs!
    glitch_window_leftright      : 2      # in seconds, data window appended left and right to detected glitch, buildung the overall window the glitch fits are perfomed.
    glitch_prepend_zeros         : 0      # in seconds, length of zeros prepended to glitch model. This can help improving fits. This time is added to to data window corresponding to 'glitch_window_leftright'.
    glitch_interpolation_samples : 0      # integer, if not 0, data glitches are fitted with accleration steps of non-zero rise times with this amount of samples maximum in beween (attempted in steps of 10 samples). If not 0, algorithm is significantly slower!
    glitch_subsample_factor      : 1      # integer, determines how many times beween two samples a glitch shall be modeled. For glitches 1 is OK. Default is one.
    spike_fit                    : True   # If True, attempt to fit spike after glitch fit. If True, removal takes longer.
    spike_subsample_factor       : 2      # integer, determines how many times beween two samples a glitch spike shall be modeled. For spikes 5 or higher may significantly improve their fits but is slower.
    spike_fit_samples_leftright  : 7      # samples left and right around fitted glitch onset where it is attempted to fit spike. Larger is slower. Default is 7.
    var_reduction_spike          : 2      # in %. Minimum spike variance reduction to be achieved if spike fit shall be removed. 2% is default.
    var_reduction_total          : 80     # in %. Minimum total variance reduction to be achieved if fit (either only glitch or glitch+spike) shall be removed. 80% is default
    show_fit                     : False  # Attention, if True, an interactive plot is shown for each attempted fit on each component!
    store_glitches               : False  # If True, instead of corrected data, only the corrections that would have been subtracted from the data is stored to file.
    plot_removal_statistic       : False  # If True, two interactive plots are shown summarising overall statistics of deglitching

                                    # Useful if glitch detector files merged for different channels of same time. 
                                    # If 'starttime_sort':False, this can take forever! If unsure, use 'glitch_min_length' from detect function.

                                    # Conversions added as new column to the end of the input file, which can mess up original notation of numbers (file overwritten)!
    convert: ''                     # if this is specified, the 'file' option is omitted and only 'convert' is processed. Result is printed into shell.
