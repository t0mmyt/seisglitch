# SEISglitch


**SEISglitch** is a Python package based on [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki).
Its purpose is to detect "glitches" in the seismic raw data of InSight's seismometers
VBB and SP, plot the detected glitches in different ways, and
remove them if possible.

Full installation guide and documentation can be found at:
