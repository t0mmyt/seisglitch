# Seisglitch


**Seisglitch** is a Python package based on [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki).
Its purpose is to detect glitches on InSight's SEIS seismometer
(both VBB and SP sensors), plot the detected glitches in different ways,
remove the glitches based on different methods, and finally evaluate the removal.
